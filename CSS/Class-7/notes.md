CSS Flexbox Guide
Introduction
Welcome to the CSS Flexbox Guide! This document aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of CSS Flexbox, a powerful layout mechanism in CSS for building flexible and responsive layouts.

What is Flexbox?
CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, commonly known as Flexbox, is a layout model in CSS that allows you to design flexible and efficient layouts. With Flexbox, you can easily align and distribute space among items in a container, regardless of their size and order.

Getting Started To start using Flexbox, you need to understand the following concepts:

Flex Container
A flex container is an element whose children are laid out using the Flexbox model. To create a flex container, apply display: flex; or display: inline-flex; to the container element.

css

.container {
display: flex;
}
Flex Items
Flex items are the direct children of a flex container. They can be laid out horizontally or vertically, depending on the flex direction. Each flex item can be individually styled using Flexbox properties.

css

.item {
/_ Flex item styles _/
}
Flexbox Properties
Flexbox provides several properties to control the layout of flex containers and flex items:

display: Specifies the type of box used for the container (e.g., flex, inline-flex).
flex-direction: Sets the direction of the main axis (row or column) along which flex items are placed.
flex-wrap: Controls whether flex items are forced onto a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
justify-content: Aligns flex items along the main axis of the flex container.
align-items: Aligns flex items along the cross axis of the flex container.
align-self: Overrides the align-items value for individual flex items.
flex: Specifies the ability of a flex item to grow, shrink, or stay the same size relative to other flex items.
order: Controls the order in which flex items appear within a flex container.
